# GifTastic
Created a simple webpage that displays a list of action starts as buttons and an input bar that allows users to input their own action star.
Each Action Star button generates 10 gif images of the respective action star clicked and remain static until clicked on.
When a user submits their own action star it will create a new button, that when pressed should generate 10 gif images of the action star
they chose to submit.
